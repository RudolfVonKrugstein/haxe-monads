haxe-monads
===========

A collection of monads based on [monax](https://github.com/sledorze/monax). See the [monax](https://github.com/sledorze/monax) page for usage.

Most of these monads are about sequencing actions, that take time and rely and the result of the previous action.
Futures or Signals from [tink_core](https://github.com/haxetink/tink_core) are used in many monads.

These are monads I regularly use for games in openfl.
